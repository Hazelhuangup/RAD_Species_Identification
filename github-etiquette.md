1. Every folder should have a specification file names README_XXX. Refer to Research_Data_Management.pdf for the naming and file formating system.
2. No space in names and contents of any file, use ’_‘ instead.
3. Always pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn't want anyone's work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.
4. No other language than English or funky characters should use.
