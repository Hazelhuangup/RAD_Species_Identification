# RAD_Species_Identification
### Meta-analysis of RADseq in telling species apart.

Reduced-representing genome sequencing methods provide data from thousands of genomic loci at reasonable cost. Many studies focusing on wild population phylogeny using those methods have been published. By compiling phylogeny trees from those studies and re-analysing the raw sequencing data, I expect to find out monophyletic ratio of published plant groups, and try to answer the question of why some species are distinguishable.
